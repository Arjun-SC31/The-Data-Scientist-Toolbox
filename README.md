# The-Data-Scientist-Toolbox
A set of notebooks that can take a dataset and autmatically perform the data cleaning and preprocessing stages based on your input option preferences. 
Notebooks currently available for Regression, Classification and three forms of clustering. The aim is to develop a web application or a Desktop Application in the future.

Stages in the notebooks:

1. Data Exploration (Pandas Functions: Head, Describe, Info; Seaborn: Correlation Heatmap, Histogram of all columns)
2. Data Preprocessing (Label Encoding, Missing Value Imputation, One-Hot Encoding, Duplicate Removal, Outlier Detection and Removal, Datetime Extraction)
3. Data Standardization.
4. Train-Test-Split (Only for Regression and Classification)
5. PCA
6. Models (Regression: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine; Classification" Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine; Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical, DBScan)

All models have hyperparameter optimization, and either one of their coefficients or relative feature importances. For Lasso, the coefficient path is also displayed.

Future Updates: Code for Hypothesis testing (z-test, t-test, Chi-Square test, etc.,)
